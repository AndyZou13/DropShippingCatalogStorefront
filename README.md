# DropShippingCatalogStorefront
 
Our objective is to build a dropshipping catalog database that maintains an array of products that consumers can order through a website. The products are stored in the catalog with many key identifiers that make it easy to find. The search engine will use exact word matching to search for a certain product and along with the product returned, products with the same tags will be recommended under. E.g. “spatula” would be searched and any product name with the word spatula will be returned along with other products under that include the “houseware” tag.

The system offers certain products to certain users depending on the location they reside. They can however purchase products offered in other regions given that the owner/manager has given that permission to that specific user. A request would have to be submitted and reviewed in order for the approval of this option. 

The owner/manager of the store is able to restrict users and enable users based on specific user requirements. The owner/manager can add, remove, and restrict products and edit every aspect of the catalog. They can also manage shipping details and view every order that is placed on their website. Managers also have to process returns in which they would read the review from the customer asking for a refund/return. 

A user must be able to look for a specific product using different attributes. Certain products would also be recommended if they fall under the same category.  The user is able to add a product to the cart, buy a product, and return previously purchased products on certain terms and conditions.
